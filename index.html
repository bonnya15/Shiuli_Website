								<p>Hi, Shiuli here. I am currently pursuing M.Sc. in Data Science from Chennai Mathematical Institute.
								I am also a visiting industry project intern at INSEC TEC, Portugal working under the supervision of
                                Dr. Ricardo J Bessa and Dr. Carla Goncalves. My research interest includes a vast horizon of Data Science
                                applications in the domain of Electrical Engineering. I am currently working on the development of a
                                hypothetical data market for renewable energy consumption prediction. <br /> <br /> <br />
                                I have completed my B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Durgapur in 2018.
                                After graduation I worked with Jindal Stainless Limited as an Associate Manager at Cold Rolling Mill Electrical and Automation Department
                                for two and a half years. <br /> <br /> <br />
                                I am also a singer by passion. I have been learning Indian Classical Music since my childhood. I usually spend my leisure time playing piano,
                                reading story books and observing nature.

								<p> NIT Dgp was my first home away from home. Our Electrical Engineering department was so strict that we had to attend regular classes from 8:15 in the morning. Jokes apart,
                                                                    we got to learn a lot from our professors. Here, I have mentioned some of the courseworks I have enjoyed during my bachelors.

  									<li>Electrical Machine</li>
  									<li>Power Systems</li>
  									<li>Control Systems</li>

								<p> In 2020, when almost everyone lost their will to the atrocity of pandemic, in one fine afternoon, I got a call letter
                                                                    from Chennai Mathematical Institute. It was one of the most happiest days in my life. Something, which I was dreaming for

                                                                    exams in a year. We were fortunate enough to get in tough with our professors who tried their best to help us in all the aspects. Here goes the list of some subjects which
                                                                    I enjoyed most at CMI.
